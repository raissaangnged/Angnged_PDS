## Python for Data Science: Assignment 1

Assignment 1 includes 18 exercises on basic Python basic, focusing on the following topics:

* Exercises 1-3: Syntax and Variables
* Exercises 4-5: Lists and Dictionaries
* Exercises 6-7: Tuples and Sets
* Exercises 8-11: Control Flow
* Exercises 12-14: Function
* Exercises 15-17: Combination of the functions

Note: To run this code, you need to have at least Python 3.10+ to use the match statement in exercise 11. 

## Python for Data Science: Assignment 2

Assignment 2 includes 4 exercises, focusing on the following topics:**

* Exercise 1: Creating a function
* Exercise 2: Basic data filtering
* Exercise 3: Creating a to-do list
* Exercise 4: Temperature converter <br/>

## Python for Data Science: Assignment 3

Assignment 3 revolves around Object Oriented Programming. There are 4 exercises centered on creating a course registration system, specifically as follows:

**Exercise 1: Creating a course class**
* In this class, each course has the following attributes: a) a name, b) a description and c) a list of enrolled students.
* The following methods are implemented:
   * Add a student to the course.
   * Remove a student from the course.
   * Display all students in the course. 
 
**Exercise 2: Creating a student class**
* In this class, each student has the following attributes: a) a name, b) ID number, c) address and d) a list of enrolled courses.
* The following methods are included:
  * Enroll in a course.
  * Drop a course.
  * Display all registered student courses.
 
**Exercise 3: Creating a central registration class**
* This class has a list of students and a list of courses
* The following methods are implemented:
  * Enroll in a course.
  * Drop a course.
  * Display all the enrolled courses.
  * Display all the students.
    
**Exercise 4: Adding students' course grades and GPA**
* This exercise adds each student's grades per course.
* This exercise also calculates the GPA of each student, which can be called using either the student's name or ID number. 

## Python for Data Science: Assignment 4

Assignment 4 revolves around exploring Basic Libraries, such as numpy, os, re, and shutil. There are 7 exercises that analyze the filenames in an annotations subfolder, specifically as follows: 

1. Exercise 1: Counting the number of annotation files
   * Kindly note to change the 'folder' variable to your respective folder path
3. Exercise 2: Counting the files that follow the specified naming convention 
4. Exercise 3: Counting the annotation by month and year, and identifying the month with the most annotations
5. Exercise 4: Creating a new annotations folder with multiple folders corresponding to a month
6. Exercise 5: Printing the annotations from the most recent to oldest one
7. Exercise 6: Getting data on the satellite numbers, specifically:
   * Counting the number of different satellites
   * Counting the number of annotations per satellite number
   * Identifying the satellite number in the most recent annotation
8. Exercise 7: Counting the number of unique regions

**Important tasks:** 
  * You need to download the "session_4" folder that can be found inside the "Assignment 4" folder, as this includes the annotation files used.
  * In Exercise 1, make sure to change the "folder" variable to your respective folder path
