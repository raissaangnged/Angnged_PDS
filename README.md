Exercise 2: Basic data filtering
Exercise 3: Creating a to-do list
Exercise 4: Temperature converter <br/>

### Python for Data Science: Assignment 3

Assignment 3 is revolves around Object Oriented Programming. There are 4 exercises centered on creating a course registration system, specifically as follows:

**Exercise 1: Creating a course class**
* In this class, each course has the following attributes: a) a name, b) a description and c) a list of enrolled students.
* The following methods are implemented:
   * Add a student to the course.
   * Remove a student from the course.
   * Display all students in the course. 
 
**Exercise 2: Creating a student class**
* In this class, each student has the following attributes: a) a name, b) ID number, c) address and d) a list of enrolled courses.
* The following methods are included:
  * Enroll in a course.
  * Drop a course.
  * Display all registered student courses.
 
**Exercise 3: Creating a central registration class**
* This class has a list of students and a list of courses
* The following methods are implemented:
  * Enroll in a course.
  * Drop a course.
  * Display all the enrolled courses.
  * Display all the students.
    
**Exercise 4: Adding students' course grades and GPA**
* This exercise adds each student's grades per course.
* This exercise also calculates the GPA of each student, which can be called using either the student's name or ID number. 

### Python for Data Science: Assignment 4

This repository contains the code for my Python for Data Science Assignment 4. This assignment includes 7 exercises, focusing on exploring basic libraries - such as numpy, os, and shutil. Particularly, these exercises analyze the annotations subfolder in a zip file, as follows:
1. Exercise 1: Counting the number of annotation files
2. Exercise 2: Counting the files following the naming convention 
3. Exercise 3: Counting the files by month and year
4. Exercise 4: Creating a new folder based on each file's month
5. Exercise 5: Printing the files by date recency
6. Exercise 6: Getting data on the satellite numbers
7. Exercise 7: Counting the unique regions

You need to download the session_4.zip file as this includes the annotation files used. 

For set up, you can clone the repository or directly download the file, and open the notebook using Jupyter notebook. Kindly run the code to see the different exercises.
