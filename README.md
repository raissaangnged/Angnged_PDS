**Python for Data Science: Assignment 4**

This repository contains the code for my Python for Data Science Assignment 4. This assignment includes 7 exercises, focusing on exploring basic libraries - such as numpy, os, and shutil. Particularly, these exercises analyze the annotations subfolder in a zip file, as follows:
1. Exercise 1: Counting the number of annotation files
2. Exercise 2: Counting the files following the naming convention

You need to download the session_4.zip file as this includes the annotation files used. 

For set up, you can clone the repository or directly download the file, and open the notebook using Jupyter notebook. Kindly run the code to see the different exercises.
